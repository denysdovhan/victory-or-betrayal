[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/denysdovhan/victory-or-betrayal.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

> React app that helps you recognize betrayal and victory.

Actually, this is just an application which helps me to try new bleeding edge technologies. This is something like _sandbox_.

## What is _victory and betrayal_?

**Victory and Betrayal** is an Ukrainian meme. Originally it sounds like _«зрада і перемога (zrada i peremoha)»_. Sometimes people also talk about _генотьба (genotba —
shame)_.

Long story short: when something goes wrong — it's a **zrada (betrayal)**, when everything goes well — it's a **peremoha (victory)**. So if you don't understand what is going on, just type ask and you'll get an asnwer.
